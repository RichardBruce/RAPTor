-- Directory structure --

* 'anim':

  Contains files with arguments and waypoints for generating animations.
  The arguments file specifies model type & path, camera orientation, lights, fps and many other
  things that are described further in the 'usage' section below.
  NOTE: This directory should probably be renamed to something else, e.g. 'config' or 'args'.

* 'src':

  Contains the 'rt_anim.py' script for generating animations. The arguments from the 'anim' folder
  are passed to the script.


-- Usage --

* Generating an animation:

  To generate an animation, simply run the 'rt_anim.py' script with arguments from the 'anim' folder.
  For example:
  	
  	cd anim/sponza
  	../../src/rt_anim.py `cat sponza_args`

  The script will create an output folder containing the rendered frames as well as an avi file with
  the video generated from the frames.

* Options:

  For an example of the option format, you may refer to 'animation/anim/sponza/sponza_args'.
  (*) means you may specify more than one of these options.

  --model_type   [obj|nff|lwo|mgf]
  --model_path   [path]                        : E.g. scenes/obj_scenes/sponza/sponza.obj

  --cam_fwd      [x y z]
  --cam_right    [x y z]
  --light (*)    [x y z ra r g b d]            : ra=radius, [r g b]=colour, d=intensity fall off
  --fps          [number of frames per second] : Sets fps_render and fps_video to the same value.
  --fps_render   [number of frames per second] : Sets fps to use when rendering.
  --fps_video    [number of frames per second] : Sets fps to use when encoding video.
  --x_res        [horizontal resolution]
  --y_res        [vertical resolution]
  --output_dir   [path]                        : Path to directory to store rendered images.
  --cam_mode     [left|right|both]             : left=left eye camera only, both=both eyes (for 3d)
  --out_vid_name [filename]                    : Path & name of avi file to generate, e.g.
                                                 '/some/path/sponza.avi'
  --start_at     [frame number]                : Start rendering from a given frame.
  --end_at       [frame_number]                : End rendering at a given frame.
  --remove_pics_after_merge                    : When using --cam_mode both, remove the left and
                                                 right camera snapshots after merging them.
  --waypoints    [filename]                    : Name of file containing camera waypoints, e.g.
                                                 'sponza_waypoints'.
  --dont_merge                                 : In cam_mode both, don't merge left and right camera,
                                                 unless the merged file is missing. Default behaviour
                                                 is to always merge and overwrite existing files.  
  --silent                                     : Suppress printouts.
  --skip_render	                               : Don't render, assume snapshot files already exist.
  --left_cam     [path/filename pattern]       : Path and filename pattern for left camera snapshots,
                                                 where %d is used in place of an integer frame number.
                                                 NOTE: excluding suffix. E.g.: '/some/path/bla_%d_rgh'
  --right_cam    [path/filename pattern]       : Path and filename pattern for right camera snapshots,
                                                 where %d is used in place of an integer frame number.
                                                 NOTE: excluding suffix. E.g.: '/some/path/bla_%d_rgh'
* Waypoints:

  The waypoints file contains intermediate positions for the camera while generating the animation. The
  camera position is interpolated between waypoints. Waypoints can be edited as illustrated in the file
  'anim/sponza/sponza_waypoints'. Each line in the waypoints file (except lines prefixed by #, which are
  comments) describes a waypoint of the format:
  
  x y z sec foc eye

  x y z = camera position
  sec   = seconds between waypoints
  foc   = focus distance, the distance to the point where left and right eyes (cameras) view vectors cross
  eye   = eye distance, the separation distance of the two eyes
  
  Two consecutive lines describe the movement of the camera(s) between two waypoints, starting at the top
  of the file. The sec,foc,eye configuration of the beginning waypoint is used during the movement towards
  the end waypoint. (That means, the sec,foc,eye of the last line in the waypoints file will never be used).
