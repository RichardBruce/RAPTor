* Improve BEntity support (dynamic geometry such as doors, walls, etc)
    - How does Quake2 exclude these surfaces when traversing the BSP tree?
* Fix problems at borders of textures, e.g. skybox
* Animated textures
* Add a player character, to be able to see one's own reflection
* Why doesnt SDL_MapRGB work on certain machines?
* Translucency, alpha surfaces (make these surfaces refract?)
* Filtered picture scaling
* Transparent background colour for sprites
